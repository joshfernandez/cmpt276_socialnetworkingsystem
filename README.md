# CMPT 276 Group Project - Social Networking Interaction System

A program using Microsoft Azure's storage tables to create a Facebook-based interaction system between different clients. This was a semester-long, server-client interaction project I developed in a team of 4 members for my CMPT 276 (Introduction to Software Engineering) class.

Specific tasks included:

* Writing functions using C++ object-oriented programming and lessons taught in lower-division courses to install get, put, post, and delete operations necessary for the system and appropriate to the audience
* Implementing authentication and authorization by using 185-bit string tokens and checking operations using these tokens to add security to the system
* Organizing versions of code using GitLab's version control system and the concept of feature branch workflow to formalize delegations quicker and minimize merge conflicts between code of any two members
* Designing tests for both the server and the client using the UnitTest++ framework to organize tests focused on different operations and processes
